# MCLLH
A binned likelihood for stochastic models.
This repository contains example implementations of likelihoods described in [J. High Energ. Phys. (2019) 2019: 30.](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06(2019)030) in both C++ and python.
These implementations are written as stand-alone files so they can inserted directly into analysis code.
